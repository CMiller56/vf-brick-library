# Mission Planner (GCS)

**Brick id:** `ArduPilot_MissionPlanner`  
**Chunks:** 182  
**Package:** `ArduPilot_MissionPlanner_portable.zip` (~800 KB)

## Purpose

Mission Planner ground-control documentation facet (calibration, setup, common workflows).

## Audience

GCS operators and setup tinkerers offline.

## Snapshot (critical for this domain)

Corpus packaged **2026-07-18** from Mission Planner / common ArduPilot GCS MD corpus. UI labels change by MP version.

## Export / quality gate (what “waived” meant)

Soft residual craft debt at export (non-blocking).

Internal Job C soft-gate language is **not** a silent pass. If a card previously said only `Export gate waived: True` without explanation, treat that as insufficient — this section replaces it.

## Known limits / residual (specific)

- Screenshots and menu paths age quickly — prefer concepts over pixel-perfect UI steps.
- A few soft craft flags may remain from HTML/MD conversion.

1. Download and unzip `ArduPilot_MissionPlanner_portable.zip`.
