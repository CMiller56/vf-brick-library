# Look, don’t trust me — ArduPilot Plane retrieval demo

**Brick:** [`ArduPilot_Plane`](bricks/ArduPilot_Plane/)  
**Generated:** 2026-07-23  
**Method:** cosine top-3 over brick embeddings (nomic-embed-text), query embed via EmbeddingSystem

This page is a **published, verifiable demonstration** that the brick retrieves real content — not a marketing claim.

## What this is (and is not)

| This demo shows | This demo is not |
|----------------|------------------|
| **20 real questions** run against the **published brick embeddings** | An LLM “chat” transcript (no model invented these excerpts) |
| **Top-3 hits** with **cosine score**, **chunk id**, **heading**, and **excerpt** | A guarantee of perfect answers or flight-critical advice |
| Evidence you can **re-run yourself** after unzipping the brick | A substitute for reading the original ArduPilot docs |

Anyone with the portable ZIP + the same embed model can reproduce these rankings.

## Brick vs raw dump (why packaging matters)

| | Raw multi-page wiki / HTML dump | This knowledge brick |
|--|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Unit of retrieval** | Whole files or messy scrape blobs | **Chunks** with headings + stable ids |
| **What you get for a question** | Hope Ctrl+F or a giant context window hits | Ranked passages with **citations** (chunk + section) |
| **Quality honesty** | Silent garbage, nav chrome, duplicate pages | Residual craft notes on the card; bad regions flaggable |
| **Facet** | One infinite site | **Ops brick** separate from **params** brick — right book for the job |

The point of VF Pro is not “another chatbot.” It is **manufacturing packages** where strangers can **see** retrieval quality.

## How to re-run (reproduce)

1. Download [`ArduPilot_Plane_portable.zip`](bricks/ArduPilot_Plane/ArduPilot_Plane_portable.zip) and unzip.
2. Load `embeddings.npy` + chunk list from `kb.json` / `chunks.jsonl`.
3. Embed each question with **nomic-embed-text** (same family as the brick).
4. Cosine-rank against the matrix; compare top hits to the table below.

Scores below are **cosine similarity** (higher is better). Excerpts are truncated source text from the hit chunk — not model paraphrases.

## Twenty questions

### 1. What is ArduPilot Plane used for?

| Rank | Score | Chunk | Heading |
|------|------:|-------|---------|

**Top excerpt** (`chunk-0066`):

> Selecting the right board depends on the physical constraints of the vehicle, features desired, and the applications that you want to run. Factors to consider are: Sensor Redundancy: ArduPilot supports redundant IMUS, GPS, etc. Many controllers have multiple IMUs integrated on board for applications requiring this leve

| 2 | 0.677 | `chunk-0263` | — |

**Top excerpt** (`chunk-0260`):

> So to gain altitude you should raise the throttle, and to lose altitude you should lower the throttle. If you want Plane to take care of holding altitude then you should look at the FlyByWireB mode. In FBWA mode throttle is manually controlled, but is constrained by the THR_MIN and THR_MAX settings. In FBWA mode the ru

### 4. How does automatic takeoff work?

| Rank | Score | Chunk | Heading |

| 2 | 0.742 | `chunk-0314` | TAKEOFF Heading |
| 3 | 0.741 | `chunk-0298` | — |

**Top excerpt** (`chunk-0313`):

> ## NAV_TAKEOFF Mission Command ### ¶ The takeoff mission command specifies a takeoff pitch and a target altitude. The takeoff mission item is considered complete when the plane has reached the target altitude specified in the mission. The mission will then execute its normal end of mission behavior if it runs out of co

### 5. What is RTL and when does it trigger?

| 2 | 0.697 | `chunk-0310` | RTL_AUTOLAND |
| 3 | 0.676 | `chunk-0309` | — |

**Top excerpt** (`chunk-0287`):

> For Plane the home position is initially established at the time the plane acquires its GPS lock. It is then continuously updated as long as the autopilot is disarmed. This means if you execute an RTL in Plane, it will return to the location where it was when it was armed - assuming it had acquired GPS lock. Consider t

### 6. How do I calibrate the airspeed sensor?

| Rank | Score | Chunk | Heading |
|------|------:|-------|---------|

| 2 | 0.814 | `chunk-0009` | Checking operation |
| 3 | 0.795 | `chunk-0010` | Miscalibration Safeguards |

**Top excerpt** (`chunk-0317`):

> ## Calibrate the airspeed sensor ### ¶ This only applies if you are using an airspeed sensor. A properly installed and calibrated airspeed sensor enables your model to fly with much better control over its airspeed, which in turn enables lower speeds to be used safely, extending endurance. For this reason if you are in

**Top excerpt** (`chunk-0213`):

> ## Disabling the Pre-arm Safety Check ### ¶ Warning Disabling pre-arm safety checks is not recommended. The cause of the pre-arm failure should be corrected before operation of the vehicle if at all possible. If you are confident that the pre-arm check failure is not a real problem, it is possible to skip a failing che

**Top excerpt** (`chunk-0323`):

> If the speed is too high, then TECS_SINK_MAX should be reduced. If the demanded pitch angle is constantly at the limit set by PTCH_LIM_MIN_DEG , then either the pitch angle limit PTCH_LIM_MIN_DEG needs to be reduced (become more negative) or the maximum sink rate TECS_SINK_MAX needs to be reduced.

**Top excerpt** (`chunk-0263`):

> As with FBWA, the rudder is under a combination of manual control and auto control for turn coordination. You should also have a look at CRUISE mode, as it is generally better than FBWB, especially if there is significant wind. In CRUISE mode the aircraft will hold a ground track as opposed to just leveling the wings w

**Top excerpt** (`chunk-0334`):

> When turning, the autopilot will monitor the demanded bank angle and airspeed and work out if there is a sufficient margin above the stall speed to turn at the demanded bank angle. If not the bank angle is limited to the safe value. The stall prevention system will always allow a bank of at least 25 degrees (to ensure

The plane will try to hold its heading during takeoff, with the initial heading set by the direction the plane is facing when the takeoff starts. It is highly

## Honest notes

- Some headings are empty in metadata; the **excerpt and chunk id** still locate the passage.
- A few questions (e.g. VTOL-specific modes) may rank **related** ops/failsafe text rather than a perfect single page — that is useful signal for re-cuts, not something to hide.
- This is **retrieval evidence**, not an autopilot. Do not fly on library demos alone.

## Feedback

If a hit looks wrong, open an [Issue](../../issues) titled `ArduPilot_Plane: <your question>` and paste what you expected. That is how the library gets better.
